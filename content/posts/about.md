Batter Blotter is a blog by Francesca Picarazzi and Cristián Romo on the topics
of cooking, baking, gardening, and self-sufficiency. We talked about starting a
bread blog in 2019 but never did. Since then, we've made our own cheese, wine,
and many loaves of bread with little more than pictures and full bellies to show
for it. One day, during our free time during lockdown in May 2020, we finally
started the blog to chronicle our adventures.
